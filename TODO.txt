-> Next Goals:
 * Refactorize Object Prefab Instantiation from tiled Convention,
Using something more intuitive like type Configs inside Tiled 0.9

 * Add Player level Spawn reading (a feature too)
 * Add Warp system level like: Input -> A ... Output -> A ( Door -> WarpTo: Id, Warp -> WarpTo: "File...tmx")
 * Edit Items and projectiles TileSets...
